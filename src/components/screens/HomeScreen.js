            Fade up with the persistent uncertainty surrounding the 'pay on
            delivery' scenarios between sellers and buyers, coupled with the
            resulting lack of trust? Paysofter Promise fills in this gap! With
            Paysofter Promise, payments made to a seller (utilizing the buyer's
            funded Paysofter Account Fund) are securely held in escrow until
            specified conditions agreed upon by both the buyer and seller are
            met.
